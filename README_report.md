# GC_calc-complexity-project

**Human miRNA seed region**

* load sequences from fasta file <C:\Users\user\AP\day6\data\mature.fa>
* loaded <48885> sequences and kept <2656> with species code [hsa] 
* 2094 unique seed sequences were found
* The unique seed sequences output fasta file is strored <C:\Users\user\AP\day6\data\mature__uniqseeds.fa>
