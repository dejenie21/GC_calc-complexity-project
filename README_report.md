## miRNA seed region analysis

**For all species**
* The seed region is defined to run from miRNA position <2>--><8>
* We loaded the sequences from fasta file <C:\Users\user\AP\day6\data\mature.fa>
* The unique seed sequences output fasta file is strored <C:\Users\user\AP\day6\data\mature__uniqseeds.fa>

**Human miRNA seed region**

* 48885 miRNA sequences are loaded and from this 2656 sequeces are from Homo sapiens with species code "hsa"
* From 2656 hsa miRNA, there are 2094 unique seed sequences.
* The unique seed sequences output fasta file is strored <C:\Users\user\AP\day6\data\mature__uniqseeds.fa>

**calculate GC frequency in miRNAs of human**

+ The average GC % of miRNA sequences Homo sapiens is 70.1%
+ We used the fasta file  <C:\Users\user\AP\day6\data\mature.fa> run with speciesCode is <hsa>
+ The project log file is saved at <C:\Users\user\AP\day8\software\complexity\logfiles\mature__20230421_153836__3697017c62772d71b4445895933026a4.log>

**Mouse miRNA seed region**
          
* 48885 miRNA sequences are loaded and from this 1978 sequeces are from mouse with species code "mmu"
* From 1978 mouse miRNA, there are 1588 unique seed sequences.
* The unique seed sequences output fasta file is strored <C:\Users\user\AP\day6\data\mature__uniqseeds.fa>
          
**calculate GC frequency in miRNAs of mouse**
          
+ The average GC % of mouse miRNA is found to be 70.5%
+ The fasta file used is <C:\Users\user\AP\day6\data\mature.fa> run with  speciesCode is <mmu>        
+ The project log file is found in <C:\Users\user\AP\day8\software\complexity\logfiles\mature__20230421_154730__3697017c62772d71b4445895933026a4.log>

**Rat miRNA seed region**

* 48885 miRNA sequences are loaded and from this 764 sequeces are from rat with species code "rno"
* From 764 rat miRNA, there are 635 unique seed sequences.
* The unique seed sequences output fasta file is strored <C:\Users\user\AP\day6\data\mature__uniqseeds.fa>              
+ The unique seed sequences is found at output fasta file is <C:\Users\user\AP\day6\data\mature__uniqseeds.fa>
          
**calculate GC frequency in miRNAs of rat**

+ The average GC % of miRNA from rat is foind to be 67.47%
